Consequences of not addressing mental health issues are manifold and can include unnecessary disability, unemployment, substance abuse, homelessness, inappropriate incarceration, poor quality of life, and suicide.

### What should you not say when talking about mental health?

When discussing mental health, it is crucial to remember that language matters. Being mindful of the way we talk about mental health and associated problems can help lessen the stigma and make people feel more comfortable talking about their own experiences.

That said, mental health does not include behavioral health and solely involves examining one&lsquo;s mental state. Learn more at this resource.
