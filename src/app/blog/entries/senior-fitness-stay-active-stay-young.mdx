## FAQ

### What are the consequences of not addressing mental health issues?

Consequences of not addressing mental health issues are manifold and can include unnecessary disability, unemployment, substance abuse, homelessness, inappropriate incarceration, poor quality of life, and suicide.

### What should you not say when talking about mental health?

When discussing mental health, it is crucial to remember that language matters. Being mindful of the way we talk about mental health and associated problems can help lessen the stigma and make people feel more comfortable talking about their own experiences. For example, avoid describing a person according to their diagnosis or behavior. Instead, use language like “They are a person living with depression.” As well, avoid using words such as “suffer” or “victim of.”

### What are the differences between mental health and behavioral health?

The main difference between behavioral health and mental health is that behavioral health is considered a “blanket term” that includes mental health within its umbrella because it looks into how a person&lsquo;s daily actions can affect their mental state. That said, mental health does not include behavioral health and solely involves examining one&lsquo;s mental state. Learn more at this resource.
